Pomotro is a basic and minimalistic Pomodoro Timer for desktop. It helps you stay productive and focused by using the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method that breaks work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

## Overview
Pomotro is inspired by the popular Pomodroid app created by splode, but with a more compact design and simplicity in mind. It is developed by [Ranork](https://github.com/Ranork) in their free time, aiming to create a visually pleasing and efficient Pomodoro timer.

## Features
- Pomodoro Time Tracking: Monitor your focused work sessions with 25-minute intervals, known as "Pomodoros."
- Break Time Tracking: Keep track of your short breaks between Pomodoros to ensure you take timely and rejuvenating breaks.
- User-Friendly Interface: The app stays always on top and conveniently located in the bottom right corner of your screen for quick access.
- Start/Stop Timer: Easily start or stop the Pomodoro timer to customize your work and break sessions.
